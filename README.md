# 🚀  EOS-Bench
**A unified, high-performance, and extensible benchmark platform for **Earth Observation (EO) satellite scheduling**.**

Designed to tackle the complexities of large-scale constellation management, this project bridges the gap between traditional operations research and modern AI scheduling techniques. It features a complete pipeline from scenario generation (powered by Orekit) and diverse algorithm benchmarking, to interactive 3D visualization.

---

This project provides:

* 📦 A scalable scenario generation framework (1–1000 satellites, 1h–168h horizon)
* ⚙️ A unified constraint & evaluation model
* 🧠 Multiple scheduling paradigms:

  * MIP (Exact Optimization)
  * Heuristics
  * Meta-heuristics (SA / GA / ACO)
  * PPO Reinforcement Learning
* 📊 Standardized performance metrics
* 🌍 3D dynamic visualization via Cesium

## 🔥 Key Features

* **Scalable Scenario Generation**: Generate realistic tasks and orbital mechanics for constellations ranging from 1 to 1000+ satellites over 1h–168h horizons. Supports randomized mission distributions or precise JSON-based city targets.
* **High-Fidelity Constraint Modeling**: Natively supports **Agile and Non-Agile** satellites with piecewise attitude transition time models (Δroll, Δpitch, Δyaw), power consumption, and data storage limits.
* **High-Performance Candidate Pool**: Employs truncated, diversified candidate sampling (Earliest, Center, Latest, Random) coupled with Early Accept and dynamic sampling techniques to keep complexity at O(T · K) for massive scales.
* **Unified Multi-Objective Optimization**: Standardized 0~1 normalized evaluation for Profit, Completion Rate, Timeliness, and Balance Degree.
* **Automated 3D Visualization**: One-click generation of CZML files for dynamic orbit and scheduling visualization via Cesium.

## 🛠 Installation

### 1️⃣ Install Java (Required for Orekit)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk
```

### 2️⃣ Install Python Dependencies

Python 3.10 recommended.

```bash
pip install "orekit-jpype[jdk4py]" "jpype1==1.5.2"
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy
pip install torch
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1 — Generate Benchmark Scenarios

```bash
python main_generate.py
```

Scenarios are saved in:

```
output/Scenario_*.json
```

---

### Step 2 — Run Benchmark / Train RL

```bash
python main_scheduler.py
```

Outputs:

* Schedule results → `output/schedules/`
* RL models → `output/models/`
* Performance logs → `runlog_*.txt`

---

### Step 3 — 3D Visualization

Edit scenario & schedule names in `main_draw.py`, then run:

```bash
python main_draw.py
```

A browser window will open with dynamic 3D visualization.

---

## 🧠 Reinforcement Learning (PPO)

The PPO module supports:

* Multi-objective weighted training
* Periodic checkpoint saving
* Automatic resume training
* Independent train/test mode
* Scenario resampling control (every N episodes)

Saved models include:

* Policy weights
* Optimizer state
* Episode index
* RNG states (for reproducibility)

---

## ➕ Adding New Algorithms

1. Implement your algorithm in `algorithms/`
2. Follow the unified interface
3. Register in `factory.py`
4. Add to `algo_specs` in `main_scheduler.py`

It will automatically integrate into batch benchmarking.
